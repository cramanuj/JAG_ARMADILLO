1) jaguar_ARMA.cpp -- c++ code to compute the joint score test statistic and the corresponding p-value using RcppArmadillo template.

This file has the following functions --

a) jaguar_ARMA --
- Implements our algorithm using Armadillo C++ library and RcppArmadillo template.
- Involves Matrix multiplication
- Computationally expensive (at least theoretically speaking)

b) jaguar_BALANCED --
- Implements our algorithm using Rcpp template
- Works only on "balanced designs" i.e. equal number of samples in all tissues/groups. 
- Simulation code

c) jaguar_NEW --
- Implements our alogorithm using Armadillo C++ library and RcppArmadillo template.
- Works on all designs (both balanced and unbalanced)
- Efficient implementation using closed-form solutions

2) jaguar.cpp -- c++ function to compute the joint score test statistic and the corresponding p-value following the closed-form solution using Rcpp template. Compared to "jaguar_NEW", it is slightly inefficient. 

3) testJAG.R -- R script that can be run to test the above code. The R file runs power simulations.

4) benchmark.R -- R script benchmarking two solutions a) RcppArmadillo, and b) Rcpp closed-form solution 

All .Rout files have executed R codes.
